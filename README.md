## Project Description

OScrabble is an implementation of the popular word game Scrabble, developed using OCaml. Our goal was to create a software replica of Scrabble, ensuring code feasibility by employing agile software development techniques like test-driven development.

Key Features:
- Implemented a stateful computation model in a functional programming style.
- Supports 2-4 players in a terminal-based interface.
- Scoring is based on the letters placed on the board, following Scrabble's official scoring rules.

Working with a team was essential for the success of OScrabble. The system we built required all members of the team to collaborate and work together to create a unified and cohesive application. We leveraged effective communication, regular meetings, and version control tools to ensure smooth collaboration and integration of individual contributions.

By working as a team, we were able to divide tasks, share responsibilities, and utilize each member's strengths to build a high-quality Scrabble game that meets our objectives.

Hope you enjoy!
